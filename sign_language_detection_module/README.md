# Sign Language Detection Module

A computer vision module for detecting whether a user is expressing sign language based on hand gestures and body pose analysis.

## Overview

This module uses advanced computer vision techniques to identify and classify sign language gestures by analyzing:
- Hand gestures and movements
- Body pose and positioning
- Spatial relationships between hands and body

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection
- Hand gesture recognition
- Body pose estimation
- Classification of sign language expressions
